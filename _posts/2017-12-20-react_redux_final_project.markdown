Due to my obsession with NBA basketball, my original plan for my final project was to create an NBA team search engine that would display a team's current roster and statistics. Unfortunately, due to the cost of acquiring an api from various sources, I had to change my plan.

For my final project,  I decided to create a rec league app that uses CRUD. My app allows a user to easily see the all teams and rosters within their league. In addition, the user can add teams to the database and assign players to teams.

One of my biggest challenges when building this project was building a team how page that would display a team's roster. In order to accomplish this task, I used my existing team and player actions that I already had. I then used actions in componentDidMount().

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/GBQB7"><a href="//imgur.com/GBQB7"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My further plans for this project is to add authentication and team standings.
