When I say the phrase 'Trust the Process', I'm not referrring to Joel Embiid, the promising young center on the 76ers, but my own process for creating a project from scratch.

As I started my Rails project, I pondered what I would do differently in the earlier stages. One of my biggest takeaways from Avi's recent lecture on 'Learning to Learn' was to start every project with a plan, so that's exactly what I did.

The first step was to brainstorm everything I had in my mind for the project onto a piece of paper. From there, I made a summary of how I wanted my app to function. I then took these ideas and adjusted them for each requirement.

After that, I came up with a step by step plan of what I wanted to accomplish. A brief sampling of my plan is below.

1. Start with creating a viewable home page
2. Install the devise gem for user authentication
3. Integrate Facebook Oauth 
4. Make and migrate database
5. Create required models and ensure that they are working
6. Include validations for each model
7. Create a nested form writing to an associated model (form to create a company and lead)
8. Create a nested resource "new" form(create a lead)
9. Create a custom attribute writer for the nested form
10. Create a scope method
11. Integrate validation errors
12. DRY my code

The step by step process above allowed me to visualize how my project would grow organically. Although my step by step process was helpful, I was only sucessful because I was granular with how I wanted to achieve each step in my notes.

Without a doubt, this was a difficult project for me to complete and I spent a lot of time getting little things like my show page to work. In the end, I would say the most important thing I did was to plan the project and follow up on it.

As the saying goes, "Trust the Process!".
